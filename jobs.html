                                  <h2>Research Scientist</h2>
                                  <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The Knowing Machines Research Scientist will design, implement, and organize research for the Knowing Machines Data Laboratory, a set of technical and data infrastructures for archiving, analyzing, and investigating the past and present of machine learning training datasets. You will be joining an active and engaged research community where you will be a key contributor and driver, with the opportunity to create original research projects spanning academic, industrial, journalistic, and creative outputs. Candidates must be familiar with training data sets, building APIs, data archiving and documentation practices, as well as machine learning approaches generally. The position will be for one year, with an expectation of renewal for an additional year. Salary is expected to be $100,000 per year, and comes with excellent <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/employees/benefit/full-time/professional-research-staff/benefits-guide-2022.html">NYU health, financial, and other benefits</a>. </p>
                                  <h4>Responsibilities</h4>
                                  <p class="fs-5 mb-4">In addition to leading on technical research projects for the Data Laboratory, as a member of the Knowing Machines research team, you will also participate in team meetings and help to guide the project toward its goals of critically investigating the construction, analysis, and deployment of training datasets. Depending on interest, capacity, and expertise, there may also be opportunities to conduct independent and collaborative research for publication.</p>
                                  <h4>Qualifications</h4>
                                  <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Ideal candidates have: a demonstrated research track record, a demonstrated interest in machine learning and training data; strong technical skills and background needed to create a research data architecture, translate early-stage thinking into system prototypes, help team members visualize data patterns, and generally support the critical data inquiries of an interdisciplinary research team. Ideally they will also have strong project management and communication skills, and will need to be able to work independently when required. As the Knowing Machines project is jointly based at NYU and USC, being located in New York or Los Angeles is preferable, but remote work is possible as well.</p>
